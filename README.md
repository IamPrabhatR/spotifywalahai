# Spotify-FLAC-Downloader-CLI

# Info
* Takes a spotify public playlist and downloads high quality 1440kbs FLAC files from Deezer servers.

# Current Capabilities
* Takes spotify playlist, uses API, parses, searches the Deezer api for the same songs and then outputs a json file of Deezer song info (including song id) to be downloaded.
* Downloads Deezer tracks through https://free-mp3-download.net/. Yes this is a shitty solution while I reverse engineer Deezer's CDN.

# UPDATE
* Just found out that <a href="https://notabug.org/RemixDevs/DeezloaderRemix">Deezloader remix</a> exists and does the same function as this. ðŸ˜‘ ðŸ”«
* Will be leaving this repo open in case anyone finds this code of any value for a project.
