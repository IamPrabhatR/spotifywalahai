# FLAC-Downloader-CLI

# Info
* Takes a spotify public playlist and downloads high quality 1440kbs FLAC files from Deezer servers.

# Current Capabilities
* Takes spotify playlist, uses API, parses and then outputs a json file of Deezer song IDs to be downloaded.
* Downloads Deezer tracks through https://free-mp3-download.net/. Yes this is a shitty solution while I reverse engineer Deezer's CDN.
